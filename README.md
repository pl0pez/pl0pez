### Hello, Nice to meet you! I'm Pedro :japanese_goblin: :wave:

My job has had many titles during my professional experience: (Associate) Researcher, R&D Engineer, (Senior) Data Scientist...

I'm just a person who loves AI and the creation of solutions to different problems.

Currently (February 2025) I am a Machine Learning Engineer and Tech Lead in EXUS AI Labs. And I am **really** enjoying this journey.

About me: 
- :tophat: I have a PhD in Engineering since 2016. It was about Short-term congestion forecasting using Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems and Genetic Algorithms. 
- :book: This is my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4KScOXwAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao) 
- :v: Although most years of my professional career have been in R&D institutions, I am deeply disenchant with the Research world (papers, etc), but not with the Development part. That's one of the reasons I've joined [EXUS AI Labs](https://www.exus.ai/). I can do both things from home! 
- :metal: I really like teaching AI concepts. That's why I joined [Saturdays.AI](https://saturdays.ai/) some years ago (I am open to new opportunities :eyes:)
- :wrench: Currently, I am programming in Python and SQL. I have experience in Java and Matlab as programming languages, and Tensorflow and Docker.
- :thought_balloon: My interest right now are Explainable AI, ML and AIOps, and creation of better prompts for this amazing age we are living in Generative AI.  
- :green_heart: I like writing, photography, read comics, watch anime, and play rogue-like and extremely difficult games. Also, van travelling and go to non-touristic places (after the touristic ones!)
